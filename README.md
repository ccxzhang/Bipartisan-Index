# Web-scrapers

The following scrapers are either part of the project that I did or merely for fun.

1. `Bipartisan-Index`: scraper and raw data for [the Lugar Center’s Bipartisan index](https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html) for 116th congress. The `Code` folder includes codes to scrape house and sentae bills and extract congress member personal details. `Data` foler contains two json files extracted from the [Biographic Directory of the United States Congress](https://bioguide.congress.gov/). 

2. `Paraguay`: scraper for [Paraguay's Comptroller General (Contraloría General de la República)](https://portaldjbr.contraloria.gov.py/portal-djbr/).

3. `FBpages`: scraper built on selenium to extract information from Facebook public pages.

4. `Zhihu`: scraper to get answers from Zhihu (Chinese version of Quora) which used Ajax.
